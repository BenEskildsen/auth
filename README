To set up:
  - clone this
  - create a .secrets.js file with jwtSecret: [SOMESTRING] and the dbURL
  - modify the dbSchema based on how you want users
  - create the users table
  - add an admin user by modifying the create function on the server.js to have max permission level
    > curl -d "username=admin&password=100bones" localhost:8000/auth/create


Main authentication types:
  - JWT:
    - pros:
      - fully implemented and secure
    - cons:
      - single page only -- can't figure out how to send a jwt to another page
  - Cookies:
    - pros:
      - easy to use across pages
    - cons:
      - harder to check that the cookie is valid and not just existing/unexpired
